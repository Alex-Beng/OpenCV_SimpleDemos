This demo is a simple use of histogram backprojection to detect an monochromatic (or nealy monochromatic) object.
The corresponding tutorial can be found [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIxOTQ3MTI5NQ==&mid=2247483949&idx=1&sn=636cd5077c1749a5dfdaa3e6de14af74&scene=19#wechat_redirect).<br />

I provide one test image with the sample patch extracted from it. Be free to use you own test images! You may be wondering how to use you camera to run histogram backprojection online. We'll see how to do this in the following tutorials.

You may find out that the outcome is very upsetting. We'll see the reason and try to modify it in next tutorial.(The corresponding demo will be 'V2')

Have fun!
